### How to Translate

#### Translate QDiscuss

Copy the [en.json file](https://github.com/ColorVila/QDiscuss-languanges/blob/master/qdiscuss/en.json), and just translate the value fileds into your languange, rename it to your_language_codes.json, and save it in QDiscuss's public/languages directory, the language_codes can see [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/iso-2-letter-language-codes/). We just use the lowercase name. After you finished the translation, select your language in your QDiscuss's dashboard.

#### Translate QDiscuss's extension

Each extension maybe have words need to be translated too, so much like the translation of QDiscuss, copy the extension's en.json file, and translate the value fields into your languange, rename it to your_language_codes.json, and save it in the extension's  languages directory.
